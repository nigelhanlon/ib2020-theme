</h3>
<br />
<p>A deep pit of shadows and fire. From the underworld comes nightmares, ghosts, and demons. In its most terrible
  precincts sinners pay—some say eternally— for the crimes or debts they have accumulated in life. Overseen by Destiny
  Death.</p>

</h3>
<br />
<p>The Shadow Realm itself is infinite, having no actual boundaries in any direction. It exists in and of itself, but is
  also tied to the material world in a very real way. It has its own geography, though it demonstrates some familiar
  similarities to the geography of the material world in some areas. This similarity can be misleading and some
  travelers of the Shadow Realm have gotten lost.</p>
