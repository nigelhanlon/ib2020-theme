  The cranes and miles of containers are a prominent feature of the Arcane skyline. Large transport ships come and go
  between Arcane and Relinquo Cove often leaving empty containers in the docks. The Oxen Corporation can often be seen
  collecting various crates filled with parts and supplies for their ongoing military operations.</p>

  Once a simply man made lake just outside the city, it has been reclaimed and repurposed. It is now host to a large
  family friendly park where children come to play and people can come and walk their dogs alongside the lake that has
  remained.</p><br />
