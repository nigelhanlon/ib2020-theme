  <a href="/f2-death-manor" class="shadow">Death Manor</a>
</h3>
<br />
<p>Isolated from the borders of Arcane, deep within the Black Woods resides Eredita Di Morte or Death Manor, the home to
  the infamous Death & Matashina's family. The numbers have dwindled over the years leaving the newer generation to hold
  down the fort. Ruled over by Hope Death-Reign-Matashina.</p>

  <a href="/f9-irae-pack-den" class="shadow">Irae Pack Den</a>
</h3>
<br />
<p>In one of the far-reaching corners of the woods, is the mouth of a cave. Within those caves now resides the members
  of the lycan Irae pack. Their residence here the result of an alliance made with the Death/Matashina family to help
  protect against the threat that Ox Corp poses. Controlled by the Alpha of the Irae pack.</p>

  <a href="/f70-the-clearing" class="shadow">The Clearing</a>
</h3>
<br />
<p>Surrounded by the large overhanging branches, all natural light is absent except for The Clearing. A somewhat
  sizeable area where the sun peeks through the foliage and trees have not yet consumed the almost perfectly circular
  land.</p>
<br />

<h3>
  <a href="/f71-the-old-oak" class="shadow">The Old Oak</a>
</h3>
<br />
<p>Deep in the forest is the oldest tree left standing. Near it's base is an old carving of a face, who it represents no
  one knows but there are those that believe that if you stare at the face for long enough, it stares back.</p>
<br />

<h3>
  <a href="/f14-the-falls" class="shadow">The Falls</a>
</h3>
<br />
<p>Following the caves, you will be led to a place simply known as the Falls. An underground waterfall dropping into the
  lowest cavern of the caves. The fresh water roars into the depths of a black hole with no end in sight.</p>
<br />

<h3>
  <a href="/f15-the-weeping-river" class="shadow">The Weeping River</a>
</h3>
<br />
<p>A small river of water that runs through the woods. It is was almost dried up, the small concentration of water had
  given way to its name but the flow has grown over the last few years. Passing through the caves, particles of the
  crystals are picked up and carried. Even in this dark wood, the water glistens, reflecting any light like tears.</p>
