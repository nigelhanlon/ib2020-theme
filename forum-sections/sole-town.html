</h3>
<br />
<p>A quaint two-story townhouse, all is not as it seems from the outside. Home to Rosalina Harmon and her coven the Sisters of Freya. Like a famous phone box, it's bigger on the inside and protected from those who wish them harm. Witches welcome.</p>

</h3>
<br />
<p>The local bar in Sole, it is a great place to lay low and let the heat die down or just go for a drink. With a pool table, darts, and plenty of beer in the taps, it's considered the only social hot spot in town. Upstairs there are a few rooms to rent for those that need them. It's not 5 star but the beds are comfy and the beer is good. Owned and run but the Dimitru's.</p>

</h3>
<br />
<p>Every morning n the middle of this small town, the market opens. Selling food, homemade goods, and even the odd second-hand goods. However, if you know who to talk too, you can access goods that aren't available to the general public for a price.</p>

</h3>
<br />
<p>The local hardware shop, it's there to meet the local's DIY needs but for a particular group of customers, they can go out the back. Only available to those they trust, an illegal weapons room is hidden where guns and other such weapons are sold to the highest bidder. It's reportedly connected to the Bayside Brawlers but you didn't hear that from me.</p>
