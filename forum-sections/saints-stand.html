  The oldest building in Otara Mortus, Saints Cathedral stands out against the modern skyscrapers in its background.
  Under current renovation the scaffolding outside does not hinder its parishioners from appearing every Sunday.

<br />
<p>Located behind All Saints Cathedral is a graveyard dating back hundreds of years. The old dilapidated tombstones a
  stark contrast to the newly opened Western plots on the far side. Many mourners can be seen during the day,
  particularly on the Western side, the Eastern older plots all but abandoned.

<br />
<p>From the front it looks like a humble dry cleaners with a simple name Gemma's Dry Cleaners. However for those in the
  know, if you make your way to the back you'll find a door. Descend down the stairs and you will find The Hidden Gem. A
  speak easy type bar located in the basement with a well stocked bar, seating and a small stage. A place for Immortals
  of all kinds to mingle, drink and compare war stories in secrecy away from mortal and more importantly Oxen eyes.

</h3>
<br />
<p>Although sounding idyllic the citizens of Saint City do not to experience the same quality of living as other cities.
  The accommodations comprise mostly of apartments that face the river. They are tall and sometimes cramped, that leads
  to the threat of pollution in it's only river. Graffiti is the only form of paint you will see on the walls as cars
  lay outside, tyres replaced with bricks. It is a tough neighborhood to grow up in and you have to be tougher to
  survive it.

<br />
<p>A bustling street, it is considered the Red Light District of Otara Mortus. Strip Clubs and adult entertainment

<p>Need somewhere to lay your head after a few too many drinks? Maybe you need a place to meet a special lady friend. If
  that's the case then Fogs Motel always has vacancies. The small rooms are equipped with a small television and a mini
  bar that has beer and nuts. But if you really want to splash out why not book the honeymoon suite for the night. The
  red shag carpeting and round waterbed will certainly make for an interesting story to tell.</p>
